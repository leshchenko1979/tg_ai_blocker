# What works
- Telegram webhook server
- aiogram handlers
- Spam classifier
- Billing via Telegram Stars
- Mixpanel tracking hooks
- PostgreSQL data layer
- MTProto bridge enrichment
- Telegram logging handler (with logfire spans)
- A `/health` endpoint returning plain `ok` for Sablier probes are live
- Comment-spam prompt now interprets linked-channel fragments with explicit suspicion thresholds. 
- Linked channel extraction optimized with username-first resolution (tries username before user ID) and direct MTProto-only approach (bot API calls removed)
- Logfire client-based message lookup implemented for reliable spam deletion from forwarded reports, scoped to admin-managed chats with 3-day search window. 
- Permission failure handling unified across spam and service message deletion: when bot lacks delete rights, admins are notified and groups are left/cleaned from DB when unreachable.
