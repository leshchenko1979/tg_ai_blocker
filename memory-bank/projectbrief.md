## Project Brief

- **Purpose**: Deliver an AI-powered anti-spam assistant for Telegram groups and channels that automatically moderates content, safeguards communities, and keeps administrators informed.
- **Problem Statement**: Manual moderation is too slow for fast-moving chats, letting spam, scams, and malicious links slip through. Admins need a dependable co-pilot that works 24/7.
- **Product Scope**:
  - Connect as a Telegram bot to moderate groups and channel comment threads.
  - Classify incoming messages with an LLM-powered pipeline and learned spam examples.
  - Remove or flag suspicious content, ban offenders, and notify admins.
  - Track usage and bill via Telegram Stars with flexible packages.
  - Provide stats, exceptions, and admin controls for fine-grained moderation.
- **Business Goals**: Grow paid usage through reliable moderation, transparent billing, and actionable insights. Maintain trust via consistent automation, human-friendly overrides, clear HTML-formatted notifications, and robust error recovery that keeps admins informed.
