## Active Context

- **Current Focus**: Cloudflare AI Gateway Integration & Spam Tactics Documentation - Migrating all LLM operations from OpenRouter to Cloudflare AI Gateway and maintaining a dedicated record of evolving spam tactics.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - **Cloudflare Primary Provider**: All bot operations (spam classification, private chat) now use Cloudflare AI Gateway exclusively.
  - **Spam Tactics File**: Created a dedicated `memory-bank/spamTactics.md` to track evolving spam patterns and examples.
  - **Spam Tactics Rule**: Implemented `.cursor/rules/spam-tactics.mdc` to ensure the memory bank is updated when new spam is discovered.
- **Recent Implementation**:
  - **Spam Tactics Memory Bank**: ✅ **Complete** - Initialized `spamTactics.md` with data from `@ai_antispam` and database.
  - **Spam Tactics Cursor Rule**: ✅ **Complete** - Added `.cursor/rules/spam-tactics.mdc` for persistent maintenance.
  - **Spam Classifier Migration**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated spam classification to use Cloudflare instead of OpenRouter.
  - **Private Chat Migration**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated private message handling to use Cloudflare for admin interactions.
  - **Environment Configuration**: ✅ **Complete** - Fixed environment variable confusion (restored OpenRouter URL, separated Cloudflare config).
  - **Code Cleanup**: ✅ **Complete** - Removed `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) dependency and refactored `sanitize_llm_html` to use regex, reducing overhead and removing unused dependencies. Updated HTML tag support to exactly match official Telegram Bot API specifications including all documented tags.
  - **LLM Provider Resilience**: ✅ **Complete** - Implemented optimized fallback strategy: Cloudflare (1 fast try) → OpenRouter (3 tries with model rotation). Cloudflare fails fast to avoid delays, OpenRouter handles retries and model fallbacks for maximum reliability.
- **Recent Implementation**:
  - **LLM Model Evaluation**: ✅ **Complete** - Comprehensive evaluation infrastructure with balanced test cases and JSON result storage.
  - **Memory Bank Documentation**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated systemPatterns.md to document Cloudflare AI Gateway usage.
  - **Logfire Trace Analysis**: ✅ **Complete** - Identified and fixed authentication issues in deployed code.
  - **Logfire Instrumentation Cleanup**: ✅ **Complete** - Implemented approved Logfire pattern: auto-tracing for modules with `@logfire.no_auto_trace` decorators on manually instrumented functions to prevent span duplication.
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  - Implement a way to collect and label "Trojan Summary" examples for the database.
  - Monitor effectiveness of the new prompt guidance.
  - Evaluate cost savings vs OpenRouter.
- **HTML Hyperlink Preservation**: ✅ **Fixed** - Modified `sanitize_llm_html()` to preserve `<a>` tags in private chat responses, ensuring hyperlinks from LLM-generated content are now clickable instead of being stripped.
- **MTProto Spam Notifications**: ✅ **Complete** - Added MTProto-based notifications to human spammers with linked channels and spamming channel administrators when spam is blocked and a channel is discovered during context collection. Fixed MCP tool call validation (chat_id as string, lowercase parse_mode) and implemented SSE (Server-Sent Events) support in `McpHttpClient` to handle `text/event-stream` responses from the bridge. Uses existing `channels.getFullChannel` response to extract human admin users without additional API calls. Notifications promote the bot by increasing reach to channel promoters.
- **Linked Channel & Display Utils**: ✅ **Complete** - Linked channel collected from profile (linked) > bio > message (first mention only). `LinkedChannelSummary` has `channel_source` ("linked"|"bio"|"message") and `channel_id`. DRY display util `format_chat_or_channel_display(title, username)` used everywhere for "Title (@username)". New-user /start uses Bot API `get_chat()` for safe linked channel (profile + bio) collection before MTProto fallback, appending offer to protect that channel.
