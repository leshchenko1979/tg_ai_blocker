## Active Context

- **Current Focus**: Cloudflare AI Gateway Integration & Spam Tactics Documentation - Migrating all LLM operations from OpenRouter to Cloudflare AI Gateway and maintaining a dedicated record of evolving spam tactics.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - **Cloudflare Primary Provider**: All bot operations (spam classification, private chat) now use Cloudflare AI Gateway exclusively.
  - **Spam Tactics File**: Created a dedicated `memory-bank/spamTactics.md` to track evolving spam patterns and examples.
  - **Spam Tactics Rule**: Implemented `.cursor/rules/spam-tactics.mdc` to ensure the memory bank is updated when new spam is discovered.
- **Recent Implementation**:
  - **Spam Tactics Memory Bank**: ✅ **Complete** - Initialized `spamTactics.md` with data from `@ai_antispam` and database.
  - **Spam Tactics Cursor Rule**: ✅ **Complete** - Added `.cursor/rules/spam-tactics.mdc` for persistent maintenance.
  - **Spam Classifier Migration**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated spam classification to use Cloudflare instead of OpenRouter.
  - **Private Chat Migration**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated private message handling to use Cloudflare for admin interactions.
  - **Environment Configuration**: ✅ **Complete** - Fixed environment variable confusion (restored OpenRouter URL, separated Cloudflare config).
  - **Code Cleanup**: ✅ **Complete** - Removed provider-specific references from generic functions, improved documentation clarity.
  - **LLM Provider Resilience**: ✅ **Complete** - Implemented optimized fallback strategy: Cloudflare (1 fast try) → OpenRouter (3 tries with model rotation). Cloudflare fails fast to avoid delays, OpenRouter handles retries and model fallbacks for maximum reliability.
- **Recent Implementation**:
  - **LLM Model Evaluation**: ✅ **Complete** - Comprehensive evaluation infrastructure with balanced test cases and JSON result storage.
  - **Memory Bank Documentation**: ✅ **Complete** - Updated systemPatterns.md to document Cloudflare AI Gateway usage.
  - **Logfire Trace Analysis**: ✅ **Complete** - Identified and fixed authentication issues in deployed code.
  - **Logfire Instrumentation Cleanup**: ✅ **Complete** - Implemented approved Logfire pattern: auto-tracing for modules with `@logfire.no_auto_trace` decorators on manually instrumented functions to prevent span duplication.
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  - Implement a way to collect and label "Trojan Summary" examples for the database.
  - Monitor effectiveness of the new prompt guidance.
  - Evaluate cost savings vs OpenRouter.
- **HTML Hyperlink Preservation**: ✅ **Fixed** - Modified `sanitize_llm_html()` to preserve `<a>` tags in private chat responses, ensuring hyperlinks from LLM-generated content are now clickable instead of being stripped.
