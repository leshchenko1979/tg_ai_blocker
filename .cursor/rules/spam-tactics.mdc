# Spam Tactics Management

This rule ensures that `memory-bank/spamTactics.md` is kept up-to-date with the latest spam examples and tactics.

## When to Update
- When a new spam example is provided by the user.
- When new spam patterns are discovered in the project's Telegram channel.
- When significant changes are made to how the system classifies or handles spam.

## Structure of memory-bank/spamTactics.md
The file should contain:
- **Common Tactics**: Categorized list of known spam methods (e.g., crypto scams, porn bots, malicious links).
- **Recent Examples**: A list of recent spam messages with descriptions and classification scores.
- **Learned Patterns**: Insights gained from the `spam_examples` database.

## Workflow
1. When a user provides a new spam example, analyze it and add it to the "Recent Examples" section.
2. Periodically (or upon request) scan the Telegram channel `@ai_antispam` for new patterns.
3. If the `spam_examples` database is updated, reflect those changes in the file.
