"""
Spam classification prompt building utilities.

This module handles the construction of LLM prompts for spam classification,
including system instructions, context guidance, response formats, and examples.

The module provides:
- SpamPromptBuilder: A fluent builder for constructing prompts with various guidance sections
- build_system_prompt(): Async function to build complete prompts with examples from database
- format_spam_request(): Formats live classification requests for the user message (prose + BEGIN/END markers).
- format_spam_example_input(): Dict for few-shot DB examples (same logical fields as live request).
- _format_context_section(): Internal helper for consistent context section formatting

Prompt Structure:
1. Base instructions (what spam classification is)
2. Context-specific guidance sections (linked channels, stories, account signals, replies)
3. Response format specification
4. Spam classification examples from database

## USER INFORMATION ANALYSIS
Examine the user's name and bio for professional labels or hidden promotions.

HIGH SPAM INDICATORS:
- NAME: Professional titles ("Psychologist", "Coach", "Investor", "Realtor"); income or offer in display name ("100к за 7 дней", "50к/мес в общаге", "Комменты без усилий", "Экспертиза бренда X"); links directly in the user's display name.

## MESSAGE METADATA SIGNALS

The following metadata fields may appear in the message:

- [VIA_BOT]: If present, the message was sent via an inline bot (e.g., PostBot). Humans rarely post via inline bots — this is a strong spam indicator, especially when combined with promotional content or external links.
- [INLINE_KEYBOARD_URLS]: URLs from inline keyboard buttons attached to the message. Spam messages often hide malicious links behind innocent-looking buttons (e.g., "Подробно" leading to phishing sites like fake government services). Treat these URLs as part of the message content for classification.""")

## TROJAN HORSE PATTERN (Critical)
When the message looks innocent or on-topic BUT the profile has strong spam indicators, this is Trojan Horse spam.

- Clean message + dirty profile can be SPAM when profile evidence is truly strong. The goal is to drive profile clicks, not add value.
- Strong profile indicators: bot link in bio, offer/income in name, photo_age=0mo or unknown.
- A "relevant" or "expert-looking" comment from such a profile is HIGH SPAM — the comment is bait.
- Do NOT let "message is relevant to reply" override profile indicators when profile has bot links or promotional name.

SIGNAL HIERARCHY: Profile indicators (name, bio, stories, profile photo age, Telegram Premium in Account Signals) can outweigh message content when they are genuinely strong (e.g. bot in bio, promotional name, gasket channel, story bait). Do NOT treat the absence of linked channel, absence of stories, and photo_age=unknown alone as multiple strong indicators — many legitimate users have empty auxiliary fields.

- Missing stories, no linked channel, and photo_age=unknown are common for ordinary accounts; stack them only with real spam signals in the message or profile (bots, offers, etc.), not as standalone proof of a "coordinated" or fake account.""")

Key metrics to evaluate:
- subscribers: Number of channel subscribers
- total_posts: Total posts ever published
- age_delta: Channel age in months (format: "11mo")
- recent_posts: Content from recent channel posts (if available)

GASKET (PROXY) CHANNEL: When subscribers < 5, total_posts < 5, age_delta=0mo — likely a "gasket" (one-post proxy channel). Strong spam indicator.

CONTENT ANALYSIS: Examine recent_posts for spam indicators like:
- Pornographic content
- Advertising or promotions
- Scams or fraudulent offers
- Spam patterns

If recent_posts contain suspicious content, this is a STRONG spam indicator,
even if the current message appears innocent. Porn channels often use innocent comments

- Advertising links or promotions

## ACCOUNT SIGNALS ANALYSIS
This section combines profile photo age (photo_age=…mo or photo_age=unknown) and optionally is_premium=true/false from Telegram.

Profile photo age is useful because spammers often use new accounts with new or missing photos.

Risk assessment (photo age alone — combine with message and other profile signals):
- photo_age=unknown OR no photo: elevated suspicion, but NOT sufficient for high-confidence spam by itself on a short, on-topic, non-bait message.
- photo_age=0mo: high suspicion for spam when combined with other promotional or bot signals.
- photo_age=1mo to 3mo: medium suspicion
- photo_age > 12mo: low suspicion from photo age alone

Telegram Premium (is_premium=true): weak legitimacy signal — paid accounts are somewhat less typical of disposable spam-only socks, but premium does NOT rule out spam. Do not argue "typical fake/new spam account" based only on empty stories, no linked channel, and unknown photo_age when is_premium=true unless strong indicators exist elsewhere (name, bio, bot links, bait in message, etc.).""")

        self.prompt_parts.append("""
## DISCUSSION CONTEXT ANALYSIS
The user message may be a reply to another post. The content of that original post is provided in the "REPLY CONTEXT" section.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
1. The "REPLY CONTEXT" is NOT the message you are classifying.
2. It often contains the spam message that the user is replying to (e.g. asking a question about a spam offer).
3. DO NOT classify the user's message as spam just because the "REPLY CONTEXT" is spam.
4. ONLY use this context to check if the user's reply is RELEVANT to the conversation.
5. "Relevant to discussion" alone does NOT mean legitimate. If the profile has strong spam indicators (bot in bio, promotional name, new account), treat even relevant comments as high-risk Trojan Horse.

6. When REPLY CONTEXT is clearly a commercial or channel promo and the message to classify is only a polite, on-topic request for details (scheme, steps, how it works) without DM bait, links in the message, or self-promo in name/bio — do NOT classify as high-confidence spam based on speculation about "coordinated campaigns", "fake interest", or stacking weak empty-field signals alone. Require concrete spam cues in the message or strong profile spam indicators.
7. High-confidence spam (e.g., 90+) requires clear evidence: concrete message-level spam cues OR multiple strong profile cues. Do not assign high confidence from weak absence signals alone.

HIGH SPAM INDICATOR: User replies that are completely unrelated to the discussion topic.

Some signs of irrelevant replies:
- Reply ignores the main topic of the original post
- Shifts to personal topics (books, movies, hobbies) with no connection
- Generic phrases like "interesting" or "I agree" without specific reference
- Self-promotion disguised as "helpful advice" on unrelated topics
- Messages in a different language than the discussion

## KNOWLEDGE SHARING & BAIT DETECTION
A frequent spam tactic is offering "free" materials to lure users into private messages or external channels.

HIGH SPAM INDICATORS:
- BAIT OFFERS: "I have a free book/course/intensive", "I can share my material", "Write to me and I'll send you the link".
- CONCRETE PHRASES (Russian): "пишите, скину бесплатно", "Могу скинуть", "пишите, скину за спасибо", "скину материал за благодарность".
- CONTEXT LURES: "архив с курсом", "курс по трейдингу", "материал" — these lure users to private chat.
- VAGUE "HELP": Offering help or sharing experience in a way that requires leaving the current discussion.
- "KARMA" BAIT: Using phrases like "giving away for free", "believing in karma", or "just want to help" to appear altruistic while posting advertisements.

## AI-GENERATED CONTENT & EMOJI DETECTION
A major spam indicator is the use of AI to generate comments that appear "clean" but add no value. This is often combined with unusual emoji patterns.

HIGH SPAM INDICATORS:

- Message is a generic rephrasing or summary of the "REPLY CONTEXT" (e.g., "This post discusses...", "Basically, the writer says...").
- Paraphrasing the post without adding insight — just ticking a "relevant reply" checkbox.
- Zero unique contribution, personal opinion, or genuine human insight.
- Spammers use Telegram custom emojis to bypass filters. You see it as an incomprehensible stream of emojis.

These AI signatures are strong indicators of spam REGARDLESS of whether the profile has promotional links
in stories or linked channels. The goal of such posts is to lure users to a bot-controlled profile.""")

Few-shot labels omit `reason` (not stored in the database). Your real response to this task must always include all three keys, including `reason`, as required by the API schema.

Confidence calibration policy: use medium confidence for ambiguous cases with mixed/weak signals; reserve very high confidence for clear evidence.
